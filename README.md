# Integrating Python + Java with XML

This peace of code shows how to communicate between Python and Java using XML for data exchange.

Let's say we have a Python script that sends XML data (sender.py) to a Java program, and the Java program processes the XML (receiver.java) and sends a response back to Python.

The Python script sends an XML request to the Java server, which processes the XML, performs multiplication, and sends an XML response back to Python. The communication is established using sockets.

Note: This code demonstrates a classical example involving those both languages.
